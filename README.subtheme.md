What are we doing?
==================

This fork of Hadron has a few objectives.

1. To function as a Serve app.
2. Use the markup of Adaptive Theme (for WCAG2 compliance).
3. To use the CSS/JS libraries of Fondation 4.

The purpose is to have a rapid prototyping tool that may eventually be ported to
a Drupal base theme.

## @TODO
QnA:
* Is Adaptive Theme really WCAG 2.0 compliant?

TASKS:
* TBD
